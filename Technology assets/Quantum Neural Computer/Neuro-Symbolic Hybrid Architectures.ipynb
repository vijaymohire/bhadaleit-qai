Deep Neuro-Symbolic Systems\n","\n","Kautz's taxonomy provides a useful framework to understand the different ways that neural and symbolic systems can be integrated to achieve more flexible, general AI. These approaches range from simpler forms of combination, like neural networks augmented by symbolic constraints, to more sophisticated forms, like meta-level integration where the system reflects on and improves its own reasoning and learning processes. As neuro-symbolic AI continues to evolve, these categories will likely become more refined, and new approaches may emerge, bridging the gap toward ***Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).***\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TowtxFf-PjZT"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jbQYCpuROhxU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731851654294,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":792,"user":{"displayName":"Vijayananda Mohire","userId":"16579720561741340503"}},"outputId":"080dc276-bbde-4e03-bf54-51f158caebfd"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Prediction: Class 5 - Regular Case\n"]}],"source":["# 4.Neuro-Symbolic Hybrid Architectures\n","\n","# Here’s a hybrid model where we use a neural network to extract features (from an image) and then use symbolic reasoning (rule-based system) to make\n","# decisions based on the extracted features.
