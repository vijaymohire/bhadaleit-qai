Deep Neuro-Symbolic Systems\n","\n","Kautz's taxonomy provides a useful framework to understand the different ways that neural and symbolic systems can be integrated to achieve more flexible, general AI. These approaches range from simpler forms of combination, like neural networks augmented by symbolic constraints, to more sophisticated forms, like meta-level integration where the system reflects on and improves its own reasoning and learning processes. As neuro-symbolic AI continues to evolve, these categories will likely become more refined, and new approaches may emerge, bridging the gap toward ***Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).***\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TowtxFf-PjZT"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jbQYCpuROhxU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731849799127,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":757,"user":{"displayName":"Vijayananda Mohire","userId":"16579720561741340503"}},"outputId":"391d944f-b888-48f9-9efc-f6150b38aaa2"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["sparrow is a bird\n","sparrow can fly\n","sparrow is not a mammal\n"]}],"source":["# 2.Symbolic-Only Systems\n","\n","# This example demonstrates a simple rule-based system.
