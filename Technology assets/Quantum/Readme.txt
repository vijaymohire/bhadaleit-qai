Future quantum computers might use quantum circuits that can add newer dimensions to the model. This might be similar to the model being used by our universe. Various research works can help in this journey. 
 
It might be possible to use more dimensions in the Hilbert space or Fock space. For example, gravity, spacetime etc. For quantum computing we use non-relativity theory while for quantum communication relativity is generally required for various operations like time keeping, synchronizing purposes in terms of field operations/ time dilation etc.We might one day starting designing quantum circuits that use more dimensions than being used today. This is possible. I strongly feel my below points can help: 

ðŸ”· Use quantum based atomic (Caesium) clocks to get timestamp of the qubit that allows for clock synchronization with different frames, under relativity theory. This can be used for quantum language, time related operations
ðŸ”· Use quantum material that is naturally affected by gravity waves or gravity quantized units, allowing Hilbert space to use gravity metrics and measurements 
ðŸ”· Use 3D and higher dimensional structures (lattices) for quantum circuit to hold the newer dimension or further add-ons, like gravity etc 
ðŸ”· Qubit is matter and is a particle. Matter - interaction with other dimensions ( that have not be experimented) can be used to develop newer theories and axioms. 
ðŸ”· Treating noise as done by nature itself. Find how nature manages noise or protects data. QEC can be expanded to search for solutions in space, cosmology events, black holes etc

These are mere pointers to develop various types of lab experiments. I can help in getting directions, subject to my knowledge level.
