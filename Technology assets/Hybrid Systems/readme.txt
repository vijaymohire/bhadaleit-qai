This folder is for the design of hybrid systems that include Quantum, AI , Classical, analog and digital systems and related design and optimizations

Few note worthy points:

1) How hybrid computing model is designed, how and where each type works well in a hybrid algos. Classical control backed by QAI, QML control can enable better control, visibility and flow logic in a execution pipeline.
2) Classical halting problem solution, quantum error thresholds to be taken care 
3) Use more abstract meta model layers, alternates to QC like Density matrix, super operators that work well across.
4) See how each type of code can operate at optimal temp. and less wiring, better encoding, mux etc.
5) What are the std interfaces used for your hub and hybrid system?. Any industrial std, open APIs etc 
6) How quantum communication protocols, payloads integrated with classical channels or vice versa, & newer protocols
7) Various hybrid models QAI, QML, classical,quantum combination models, hybrid control, open, closed loop systems
8) Use of matured classical control engg., ML based error correction and quantum speedups
