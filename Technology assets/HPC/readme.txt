This folder is for Hi Performance Computing that focuses on the QAI aspects of HPC to enable futuristic designs for the QAI supercomputer, FTQC etc and allows the reuse of the exisitng classical HPC cluster stitching with the newer QAI fabrics that allow for hi speed, low latency and all-at-once processing by the QPU in parallel in contrast to the 3 stage, 5 stage, 10 stage pipeline as in the classical part.
