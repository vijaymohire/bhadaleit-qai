For Datacenter related activites. 

Mini-Datacenter hosting provider in Newark, NJ that can do quantum simulation, cloud services to quantum backend,
private cloud hosting for Azure, IBM, GCP etc that allows for partner based HW configurations, accelerators in house
with say 1-2 member teams.

Equinix Datacenter is one popular service provider.

We do have internal capabilites of designing datacenters, however these are conventional typical datacenters for various standard racks for Web hosting, Cloud setup and Email accounts and related firewall configurations. 

We need to develop this to include the digital transformation of AI, ML, QAI, pure quantum workloads, cloud extensions to various players like IBM, Azure, GCP, AWS, D-Wave, Xanadu and use various libraries like Qiskit, Pennylane and Azure libraries. 

We also need the datacenter to progress in phases starting with simple AI workloads like classification of images, clustering of data, time series predictions, etc , later on move to ML algorithms that train algorithm to be more accurate in classification of images and use fuzzy or expert systems to make the project good. Later on we plan to move to room -temp qubits like use of photonics or ion traps that can work with the exisitng AI,ML algorithms. Once these are good, we plan to move towards QML and checking how they improve the perforamacne. Lastly we will use sub-kelvin qubits using laser cooling, dilution refrigerators etc. This will include superconductors, BEC etc. 

This is a journey and we do jobs internally and some leverage external partners.
