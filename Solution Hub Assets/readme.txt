Considerations: 

1) Tiny QML, Core QML, Optimal QML, Full QML versions that meet all types of workloads.
2) Design services, solutions and use cases that consider these sizes.
3) Also Cloud Computing VM sizes, NW capacity sizes, Storage size all make scaling easier.
4) For reducing errors full life cycles should be able to be monitored, logged and be troubleshootable across various products, productions.
5) Various workbenches, Gui editors, workflows, process orchestrators, wizards, for hub server and  hub client use 
6) Server with QAI design, development, test deploy, operations support interfaces, cloud and other connectivity while Client can enable rich Gui for various domains assets, Ent Arch, roles, projects etc. 
7) So we focus our tools that aid users and enterprises to adopt QAI easily and launch initiatives, research , experiments allowing for acceleration of use of QAI technologies.
8) Solutions will have various hw,sw, nw, Ent Arch, domain models, existing assets.How existing assets are made fit for your platform 
9) How tools help in QAI Engg, sw,sys Engg, design, develop mgmt, governances
10) How various industries , dept roles, managers, developers, staff can use in their ERP, CRM, Accounting, finances, Help desk, etc along with various QAI offerings aka NexGen solutions we have.
11) What common tools, knowledge repos for each individual industries, role, app etc
12) Establish QAI lab and direct it's operations. What are the objectives, goals and staff needed to accomplish this?.
13) What type of expertise needed. Quantum Engg, sys Engg, developers.
14) What the lab will do to take the ideas to prototype to hypothesis testing, technology demo, sample marketing, client feedback, refinements and mass production
