This folders hosts QA related assets that allow for easier management of various stds integrations, tools inteoperability, open stds etc. 
Key focus are: Industry 4,5, Cloud STDs, Quantum STDs, AI, GenAI STDs, Open source and Security STDs, Enterprise STDs, frameworks, Integration STDs, various domains related data dictionaries , taxonomies, schemas etc.

Few questions that need to be addressed are:  
How will QAI hub facilitate the fusion of these STDs, framework and any required Code, FPGA, elements in an integrated Systems, Software, HW,NW, Sec design and operations. Will this be a new architecture for QAI hub. How unique this is from other middlewares, control systems, Hybrid systems. Will it be an universal framework for the universal QC for FPGA QC.

What language will it use , Python, Assembly, and AI intelligent mapping, transformer to route data in a auto pilot model, transformer for transformation of one mode to another. 

Why is a need for another hub, when existing hybrid multi cloud, multi platforms offer good support. Will it be focused on QAI technologies like quantum internet, Intelligent nw, self diagnosis, self heal, 6G etc.
