This folder is for emerging technology incubation activities like QAI, Domain specific platforms etc
Incubation steps and methods: How QAI is incubated to a domain say agrifarming. Say implement in a nursery a small scale working model to show the benefits. In the process we identify the proper steps, methods, tools, to create a smart precise farming methodolgy. 

This will allow for better scaling and avoiding huge lossess when moved to a full scale production , say from a quarter acre to a 100 
acre scale. All the study and demo will be collected as a project knowledge and applied to other projects.
